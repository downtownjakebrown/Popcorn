Explain more about the popups, how you can stylize them. How you can present them using the environemtn. How customizing the popups feels familiar because they are just views. How the popups have collision preventance because only one can be shown at a time. 



## Installation

`Popcorn` is available as a **Swift Package**. To integrate `Popcorn` into your Xcode project, specify this packages repository URL (see below) at `File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency...`

```

```

#### More on Swift Packages:
The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.



## Implementation

#### Setup:

As described above, Popcorn is a system for creating, storing, and presenting popups in your SwiftUI app. At a high level, the system includes:
1. A (growing) number of customizable popup view templates;
2. A environmental view model for storing and coordinating presentation of the popup views; and
3. A view modifier for injecting the popup views and the environmental view model into your app's view hierarchy.
